TEASER
INT. REAL ESTATE OFFICE - DAY
TIGHT on an EMPTY CHAIR in front of a desk, in this pleasant
but bland corporate office. A man wearing a SUIT AND TIE -not as fancy as Hugo Boss, but something nice from Men’s
Wearhouse -- enters frame, visible only from the neck down.
As he sits into frame, we REVEAL that this well-dressed man
is none other than JESSE. His eye is now completely healed
and his hair is neatly combed. Without his usual knit cap
and baggy clothes, he looks like a different person. Sharp,
handsome... respectable even.
He’s also a little nervous. He’s got a piece of paper in
his hand. He slides it across the desk toward us.
JESSE
(earnest)
My resume. I haven’t worked in
real estate before, but I do have a
background in sales. I think I
could be a major asset to your
company.
REVERSE ON -- the MANAGER of this REAL ESTATE FIRM, sitting
behind the desk, across from Jesse. He doesn’t even look at
Jesse’s resume.
MANAGER
I’m sorry, but... this isn’t a
sales position.
Jesse stares at him, confused.
MANAGER
All of our brokers have at least
two years’ on-the-job experience,
and usually a college degree.

Oh.

JESSE
(embarrassed)

MANAGER
What you would be doing is more
like advertising.
As Jesse considers this, the manager goes to the window and
opens the blinds, revealing...

... a guy, across the street, wearing a goofy foam DOLLAR
BILL COSTUME with the face cut out. He’s holding a big
cardboard ARROW-SHAPED SIGN that reads, “NEED A HOME? WANT
TO SAVE $? CONDOS FOR SALE AND LEASE.” Like those guys you
see on street corners, he is spinning his arrow sign to
attract attention.
As Jesse realizes this is the shit job he was actually
interviewing for, his face falls. Off Jesse, mortified...
EXT. REAL ESTATE OFFICE - DOWNTOWN - DAY
We’re in downtown Albuquerque, surrounded by corporate
buildings. Jesse emerges from the real estate office,
bummed out by his job interview. He lights a cigarette and
starts to head for his car when he hears:
VOICE (O.S.)
Hey, Jesse! Over here!
Jesse turns to see the guy in the DOLLAR BILL COSTUME waving
to him. The dollar bill starts to cross the street to join
Jesse, his big Mickey Mouse-like feet clomping awkwardly on
the pavement...
... when a car SCREECHES to a halt inches away from hitting
him. He bangs his hand on the hood, glares at the driver.
DOLLAR BILL
Yo, watch it! Can’t you see I’m
walking here?!
The dollar bill continues crossing and comes up to Jesse,
who recognizes his friend now that he’s this close.
It’s MARTIN JANOWSKI (25), a scrawny, scrappy dude,
definitely not the sharpest crayon in the box -- but he’s a
fun drug-buddy, the guy who never says no to a party.
JESSE
Hey, Martin.
Martin shakes his head, gestures to the street.
MARTIN
Jesus -- you see that?
(then, re: Jesse’s suit)
Nice duds.
JESSE
(smirks)
You, too.

3.

EXT. ALLEY - DAY
Jesse and Martin, who’s still in his dollar bill costume,
are hanging out in the alley behind the real estate
building, sharing a joint.
Martin has the head of his costume peeled back, exposing his
longish greasy hair. His arrow-shaped sign is on the
ground, leaning against a wall.
MARTIN
Why the hell would you want this
stupid-ass job?
JESSE
You’re doing it.
MARTIN
Only ‘cause I’m on probation. It’s
better than prison... but only by
this much.
Martin holds up two fingers an inch apart.

Jesse’s trying

JESSE
The pay isn’t bad, considering all
you gotta do is stand there.
MARTIN
Dude, you can’t just stand there.
You gotta spin the arrow. There
are moves you gotta learn -- like
the helicopter.
Martin picks up the arrow sign and SPINS it with great force
above his head like a propeller. He quickly loses control
and the sign goes flying. Jesse ducks.
See?

MARTIN
That one’s a bitch.

Jesse takes a last (discreetly shot) hit off the joint and
hands it back to Martin.
JESSE
Thanks for the toke.
Any time.

MARTIN

CONTINUED:
Martin drops the roach on the pavement and grinds it out
with his oversized foot.
MARTIN
Hey, speaking of which... think you
could maybe hook me up with some
crystal?
JESSE
(shakes his head)
I been out of business for a while
now. Actually...
(floating the idea)
I’m thinking about retiring.
MARTIN
What?! I heard the stuff you made
was unbelievable. Tweaker Bob said
it was the best he ever had, and
that’s sayin’ a lot.
Jesse nods, regretful, as he recalls his one shining
achievement: the perfect batch of meth he cooked with Walt.
JESSE
(quietly)
It was pretty awesome.
MARTIN
So what happened?
Thinking about his “breakup” with Walt, Jesse becomes
defensive, covering his hurt feelings like a jilted lover.
JESSE
Nothing. Just... I had this
partner who was helping me cook. I
mean, I did most of the work. The
dude didn’t know what he was doing,
and things got dicked up. I had to
let him go.
Martin sees an opportunity.
MARTIN
You wanna get back in business, I
can hook you up with some pseudo.
I got a connect. We could partner
up.
I dunno...

JESSE

(CONTINUED)

5.
CONTINUED: (2)
MARTIN
No pressure. Just think about it.
You know where to find me.
Martin pulls the top of his costume back into place, like
putting on a hood. He grabs his arrow sign and heads back
out toward the street, leaving Jesse to consider his offer.
INT. JESSE’S CAR - DAY
A few minutes later. Jesse gets in his Monte Carlo, parked
in front of the real estate office. He sits there for a
moment, staring out the window at Martin, who’s back at his
spot across the street.
As he watches Martin in that ridiculous dollar bill costume,
spinning his arrow sign and working in some hip-hop dance
moves, Jesse realizes there’s no way he could ever do this
job. It’s just too pathetic.
Demoralized, he reaches over to the passenger seat and picks
up the “HELP WANTED” ADS that he’d left there.
Five listings have been circled -- all menial jobs, no
experience necessary. The real estate job is one of them.
Jesse scans the ads, searching for something better. But
it’s no use -- he’s not qualified for anything better.
Frustrated, he crumples up the paper and tosses it out the
window. Then he starts his engine and drives off.

ACT ONE
EXT. WINDING ROAD - DAY
A road heading up into the mountains, somewhere near Santa
Fe (possibly the Turquoise Trail, or looks like it). The
scenery is beautiful, pristine. Walt’s Aztek enters frame,
chugging uphill.
INT. WALT’S CAR - DRIVING - DAY
WALT drives. SKYLER is with him. They’re both dressed up -Walt in his best suit and tie, Skyler in a blue taffeta
dress. She’s wearing a little too much makeup and her hair
is carefully arranged in an up-do.
Walt is anxious and preoccupied. A SMALL GIFT wrapped in
colorful Hallmark paper, the shape and size of a paperback
book (but lumpier), sits atop the dashboard.
WALT
It’s a stupid present...
SKYLER
No, it’s not. He’s gonna love it.
WALT
What was I thinking? The
invitation said “no gifts.”
Walt scratches at his collar, fidgeting like a little kid in
church. Skyler can read his body language.
SKYLER
We have to go, Walt.
WALT
I’m not complaining.
SKYLER
Yes, you are.
(then, quieter)
We need this. We’ve been through a
lot lately.
As if Walt needed a reminder of the past few weeks since
finding out he has cancer. Off Walt, staring at the road...

7.

EXT. ELLIOTT’S MANSION - DRIVEWAY - DAY
This place is huge -- and it’s no McMansion. You’ve seen
houses like this on the cover of Architectural Digest.
Inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright and the eco-conscious
movement, it’s both cutting-edge and tasteful.
There’s lots of bustling activity at the entrance. Cars are
arriving, pulling up to a valet station. Mercedes, Jaguars,
Audis, BMW’s, and a few Priuses -- all of them charcoal,
steel or black.
... Then Walt’s shit-beige Aztek putters into view, sticking
out like a sore thumb.
Walt and Skyler get out. As Walt hands his key to a redjacketed valet, Skyler gapes at the house and the wealthy,
handsome guests ascending the front steps.
Though Walt and Skyler have been here before, it’s still an
impressive sight. This is not their milieu. They’re
clearly out of their league here.
INT. ELLIOTT’S MANSION - ENTRANCE HALL - DAY
Walt and Skyler enter, immediately feeling out of place.
Walt carries his small, colorfully wrapped gift. He wilts
when he sees...
A table ahead, displaying a lavish floral arrangement, is
piled high with LARGE GIFTS, all professionally wrapped in
silver and white.
SKYLER
(under her breath)
The invitation did say “no gifts,”
right?
Walt considers dumping his present, but there’s nowhere to
hide it. So, as nonchalantly as he can, Walt walks up to
the table and tucks the gift in an inconspicuous spot.
As he and Skyler continue on, we see that the guests are
dressed down in an insouciantly stylish, “you’d never guess
this cotton shirt cost $300” kind of way. One or two wear
exotic garb (e.g. sari, dashiki) acquired on travels abroad.
By contrast, Walt and Skyler (pregnant belly aside) look
like a couple going to the prom. Aside from the tuxedoed
waiters, Walt is the only man in a suit. Sensing Skyler’s
self-consciousness, Walt gently rubs the small of her back.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
WALT
You look nice, honey.
Skyler smiles, appreciative.

Then, peering past Walt --

SKYLER
There’s Elliott. Is he talking to
Ali MacGraw?
Indeed, there’s famous actress ALI MACGRAW, glowing with
Hollywood glamour, chatting with the host of the party, the
birthday boy, the master of this empire...
This is ELLIOTT SCHWARTZ (50). Though the same age as Walt,
he exudes the energy of a younger man. He has a confidence
gained through hard-earned success. Charming and generous,
he’s impossible to dislike.
Elliott’s rocking the casual-chic look in a fitted black Tshirt, Levi’s and Mexican huaraches, which contrast sharply
against the dorkiness of Walt’s polished Florsheims.
When Elliott spots Walt, his face lights up. He excuses
himself from Ali MacGraw and heads straight over.
ELLIOTT
Walt -- you made it!
Elliott gives Walt a warm, genuine hug. Despite himself,
Walt is sincerely happy to see his old friend. Thumps him
heartily on the back.
WALT
Wouldn’t miss it for the world.
Happy birthday, Elliott.
Elliott hugs Skyler and kisses her on the cheek.
ELLIOTT
Skyler, great to see you. You look
beautiful.
(to both Skyler and Walt, re:
pregnancy)
Congratulations.
Thank you.

SKYLER

Elliott spots his wife nearby and waves her over.
ELLIOTT
Gretchen -- look who’s here.
(CONTINUED)

9.
CONTINUED: (2)
GRETCHEN SCHWARTZ comes over, elegant in her simple white
dress and her long hair worn down around her shoulders.
Attractive and highly intelligent, Gretchen is the wife that
Walt might have had once upon a time, if things had gone
differently. To him, she represents the ultimate “what if.”
(Astute viewers will recognize her from the Teaser in
Episode 102; in the Los Alamos flashback, she was Walt’s lab
partner.)
GRETCHEN
Oh my God, it’s been ages.
WALT
Good to see you, Gretchen.
Instead of hugging her, Walt shakes Gretchen’s hand. This
choice of greeting is awkward, given their history -- but no
one notices except Gretchen and Elliott. Walt pulls his
hand away first.
Gretchen turns to Skyler, smiles graciously.
GRETCHEN
Hi, Skyler. Thanks for coming.
SKYLER
Good to see you -- we missed you
the last time. I think you were in
Rwanda or something...
ELLIOTT
And she just got back from Darfur.
GRETCHEN
The Foundation awarded a grant to
the International Relief Fund.
Walt responds just a tad too enthusiastically -- again,
imperceptible to anyone but Gretchen and Elliott.
WALT
That’s so great.
(then, to Elliott)
Oh, and congratulations on the
Nobel Prize. The research you’ve
been doing... it’s phenomenal.
ELLIOTT
(sincerely modest)
Thanks. We’ve got a first-rate
team working their asses off.
We’re very lucky.
(CONTINUED)

10.
CONTINUED: (3)
Elliott glances past Walt’s shoulder, still in guestgreeting mode.
ELLIOTT
Sorry -- would you excuse us? We
gotta say hello to some people.
You two go grab a drink, mingle,
make yourselves at home... We’ll
catch up later. We’ve got a lot to
talk about.
WALT
Definitely.
GRETCHEN
See you later.
As Elliott and Gretchen move off to greet another guest,
Gretchen makes eye contact with Walt for a split second.
Then she’s gone.
Walt stands there, recovering from the confusing emotions
stirred up from the past. Skyler, unaware of Walt’s history
with Gretchen, doesn’t notice. Nevertheless, Walt tries to
cover for his weirdness. He looks around.
WALT
Oh my God. I count six Nobel
laureates in this room.
Off Walt, feeling very small.
INT. ELLIOTT’S MANSION - LIBRARY - DAY
An hour later. CLOSE ON a framed NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE
titled: “Gray Matter Technologies Closes In on Molecular
Switch.” There’s a PHOTO of Elliott, with his team of
scientists behind him, posing in a lab setting.
The article begins:
“The electronics industry wants their circuits small -- the
smaller, the better. Many foresee a day when circuits will
be as tiny as single molecules. This dream may not be so
far-fetched, thanks to the research of chemists at Gray
Matter Technologies in Los Alamos, New Mexico, led by
company founder Elliott Schwartz.”
Walt lingers in front of the article, studying it as he sips
champagne from a flute.

(CONTINUED)

11.
CONTINUED:
He’s taken refuge from the party in this magnificent
library. Everything’s mahogany and leather. The walls are
lined from floor to ceiling with serious old books,
including scientific classics written by Newton, Galileo,
Darwin, and Einstein.
This sanctum sanctorum is like heaven to Walt. A 400-yearold edition of COPERNICUS’S DE REVOLUTIONIBUS, printed in
Latin, is propped open on a lectern. Walt reverently
touches its yellowed pages.
In this private moment, Walt takes it all in. Jealousy,
regret, the knowledge of what might have been, washing over
him like a tidal wave.
A COUGHING JAG jolts Walt out of his reverie.
reminder of how much his life utterly blows.

Another

INT. ELLIOTT’S MANSION - ATRIUM - DAY
The party is in full swing. Guests are talking in clusters,
hobnobbing over cocktails. Walt wanders in, alone and
feeling awkward. Skyler’s off mingling.
A SERVER approaches Walt with a tray of sushi.
SERVER
Kanpachi?
(off Walt’s hesitation)
Very young yellowtail, on a bed of
pickled daikon.
WALT
No, thank you.
The server moves off. Walt glances around and spots Skyler
across the room, talking to Elliott. They’re deep in
conversation, looking rather serious. Curious, Walt starts
off toward them...
... but he’s intercepted by an old acquaintance, FARLEY HOM
(48). Farley has the same successful air as Elliott,
without the charm. He’s conversing with a group of men who
all look like scientist geniuses.
Walt?

FARLEY
I thought that was you.

Farley gives Walt a firm handshake.
WALT
Hey, Farley. Long time no see.
(CONTINUED)

12.
CONTINUED:
FARLEY
(to the group)
This is Walter White. Back at Cal
Tech, this guy was the master of
crystallography. One time we were
stuck on this protein problem for
weeks, and Walt just breezed right
in and said, “Synchrotrons.”
Walt forces a smile as the other men size him up.
WALT
They generate purer and more
complete patterns than X-ray beams.
Data collection takes a fraction of
the time.
The men do not appear to be impressed.
FARLEY
(points to Walt)
This is the White in “Gray.”
Everyone turns to Walt. Put on the spot, he reluctantly
explains, giving them the short version.
WALT
Back when Elliott and I were in
grad school, we came up with the
name. Schwartz -- black. Walter
White. Black and white make
gray... Gray Matter Technologies.
Although Walt does a decent job of not sounding bitter, we
can see how hard it is for him to tell this story.
FARLEY
(to the group)
Cute, huh?
One of the scientist geniuses, unaware of Walt’s history
with Elliott, is surprised and finally impressed.
SCIENTIST
So you’re running the company with
Elliott?
Walt is mortified, but covers.
WALT
Actually, no. I ended up going
into education.

13.

INT. ELLIOTT’S MANSION - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
A couple of hours later. The guests are now gathered around
Elliott as he opens his birthday gifts. Gretchen is next to
him on the couch.
Amidst the torn wrapping paper we see top-of-the-line
sporting equipment, rare Scotch, objets d’art...
Walt and Skyler are on the outskirts of the crowd, party
smiles plastered to their faces as Elliott unwraps a shiny
black ELECTRIC GUITAR. Elliott is tickled.
ELLIOTT
Oh, wow, a Stratocaster...
The gift-giver, an eccentric MUSIC PRODUCER akin to Phil
Spector, pipes in:
MUSIC PRODUCER
Not just any Strat. That’s one of
Clapton’s.
No way.

ELLIOTT

MUSIC PRODUCER
And he signed it for you.
Elliott takes a closer look to read the inscription.
ELLIOTT
“To Elliott. Sorry about the
buckle rash. Eric Clapton.”
Laughter from the crowd. Elliott flips the guitar over to
see where the varnish was worn away by Clapton’s belt
buckle. Cool.
MUSIC PRODUCER
Next time you’re in London, he’ll
give you a lesson.
ELLIOTT
Thanks, man. This is beautiful.
The music producer flashes him the peace sign. Everyone
applauds in appreciation of this rad gift, which probably
cost a small fortune.
Walt and Skyler are obviously uncomfortable amidst all this
extravagance.
(CONTINUED)

14.
CONTINUED:
SKYLER
(sotto, to Walt)
Why is he doing this in front of
everyone? What is he, eight?
Walt doesn’t answer. He’s trying to figure out how to make
himself disappear before Elliott gets to his gift.
But it’s too late. The next gift Elliott reaches for is
Walt’s. The clumsily wrapped package looks like it could,
indeed, be for an eight-year-old.
ELLIOTT
(reads the tag)
Ah, this one’s from Walt.
Elliott scans the crowd, spots Walt hiding in the back.
Walt is frozen with anxiety, fearing the most humiliating
moment of his life.
CLOSE ON WALT, watching nervously as Elliott tears the
wrapping paper off his gift, revealing...
... a package of RAMEN NOODLES. The kind that comes in a
block and costs 25 cents. Boil ‘em in water, add that nasty
flavor packet, stir and enjoy.
A confused hush falls over the crowd.
Oh my God.

Walt wants to die.

ELLIOTT
Yum-Good Ramen!

Elliott bursts into a shit-eating grin. He rises to his
feet, holding up the package of ramen for all to see.
ELLIOTT
This is what Walt and I ate for ten
months straight while we were
working on our thesis. They sold
‘em at the campus store for ten
cents a piece. It’s a miracle we
didn’t die of malnutrition. To
this day, I’m convinced these
noodles were responsible for our
success. This stuff was our
lifeblood.
As Elliott gazes with affection at the ramen, it’s clear
that he sincerely loves this simple, sentimental present.
ELLIOTT
Where the hell did you find these?
I thought they’d been outlawed.
(CONTINUED)

15.
CONTINUED: (2)
Walt shrugs cagily and smiles, relieved and delighted by
Elliott’s reaction.
ELLIOTT
Thank you, Walt. I absolutely love
it.
By now, all eyes are on Walt, who was a nobody two minutes
ago, but has suddenly been swept into Elliott’s inner
circle. Walt smiles graciously.
WALT
For the man who has everything.
EXT. ELLIOTT’S MANSION - BACKYARD - NIGHT
Later still. The party has spilled out into the backyard.
Its sprawling manicured garden resembles that of the Palace
of Versailles. The trees are decorated with twinkling
lights, a la Tavern on the Green. A CHAMBER QUARTET plays
classical music.
In a GAZEBO, Walt sits across from Elliott, finally getting
some face time with the man of the hour. Walt’s enjoying
himself now, a little buzzed, his tie loosened. We come in
mid-conversation as they’re reminiscing about old times.
ELLIOTT
And then there was your liquid
nitrogen phase, when you started
dipping everything under the sun
into it to see what would happen -WALT
At least I didn’t destroy the
microwave with my experiments.
Elliott and Walt are laughing, relishing this trip down
memory lane.
ELLIOTT
Remember that professor who hated
Robert Wilhelm Bunsen?
WALT
All you had to do was mention the
Bunsen burner and he’d go off on a
rant. “He didn’t actually invent
it, he just improved it.” Easy way
to kill fifteen minutes.

(CONTINUED)

16.
CONTINUED:
More laughter. At this moment, these two are no longer
Elliott Schwartz the millionaire and Walter White the school
teacher -- they’re just a couple of friends geeking out.
ELLIOTT
I miss this, Walt.
WALT
(quietly)
Me, too.
ELLIOTT
I forgot how much fun we used to
have just hanging out and
brainstorming. Seeing where the
conversation took us.
WALT
We should get together more often.
Skyler would love to have you and
Gretchen over for dinner sometime.
ELLIOTT
Yeah, sure, absolutely. But what I
mean is... we should work together
again.
Walt is caught off-guard.

Seriously.

ELLIOTT
What’s stopping us?

WALT
You want me to work for Gray
Matter?
ELLIOTT
Why not? You’d fit right in.
You’re brilliant, you’ve got the
experience...
WALT
Yeah, as a high school teacher.
Can’t even remember the last time I
set foot in a real lab. I’ve been
out of the loop for twenty years.
ELLIOTT
We’ll get you up to speed.
It’s dawning on Walt that Elliott is serious about this.
(CONTINUED)

17.
CONTINUED: (2)
WALT
I wouldn’t even know where to
begin. You have no idea... I spend
my day drawing atoms on a
chalkboard. Making kids memorize
the periodic table.
ELLIOTT
I understand. You’re a little
rusty. But you’re not seeing the
upside here -- it might really help
us to have a fresh set of eyes.
You know what it’s like when you’re
trying to crack the same problem
for months -- you get tunnel
vision. But one person thinking
outside the box? You may be
exactly what we need.
Walt can’t believe what he’s hearing. But man, does he want
to. For the first time in years, he sees a future that
isn’t bleak -- in fact, it’s the life he should have had.
This is his chance at redemption.
But bursting this beautiful bubble is the inescapable fact
that... Walt has cancer. His days are numbered. As the
reality of this sinks in:
WALT
Elliott... this is... this is very
appealing. But you should know...
I’ve got some... personal issues.
Quiet Walt, squashing down his emotions, has a hard time
getting this out. Elliott lays a compassionate hand on
Walt’s shoulder.
ELLIOTT
There’s nothing we can’t work out.
WALT
It’s complicated.
ELLIOTT
We can help you. We have excellent
health insurance. The best.
Walt looks to him, surprised. He knows I have cancer.

She’s not participating in conversation -- instead, she’s
looking over at the gazebo, curious about Walt and Elliott.
As their eyes meet, Skyler smiles as if everything’s hunkydory. But in this split second, Walt has figured it out:
Skyler told Elliott about the cancer.
And suddenly he sees his whole conversation with Elliott in
a new light.
EXT. ELLIOTT’S MANSION - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
The party is winding down. Guests are leaving.

The

Walt and Skyler are at the valet station, waiting for their
car. Walt is quiet and weirdly expressionless. Skyler
sneaks glances at him.
Walt’s Aztek rumbles up behind an idling Rolls-Royce and
jerks forward, coming dangerously close to dinging the
Rolls. Exhaust spurts from the tailpipe.
Ignoring stares, Walt goes around to the driver’s side.
VALET is having trouble putting the car into park.

The

WALT
You gotta jiggle it.
The valet jiggles the gear shift, to no avail. Walt, his
frustration mounting, reaches in and does it himself. The
hapless valet slides out of the car, and Walt gets in
without giving him a tip.
As soon as Skyler gets in the passenger seat and buckles up,
Walt hits the gas. The Aztek heads down the driveway.
INT. WALT’S CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT
A few minutes later. Walt stares straight ahead as he
drives. He hasn’t said a word since they left Elliott’s
house. Trying to gauge his mood, Skyler makes a tentative
attempt at normalcy.
SKYLER
Did you try the blinis, with the
caviar and the little dab of creme
fraiche? Oh my God. I must’ve
eaten about thirty of those
suckers.

At last, Walt turns to her and explodes -- not in a loud

WALT
What the fuck did you say to
Elliott?
SKYLER
(taken aback)
Walt -WALT
-- You told him about the cancer,
didn’t you?
SKYLER
(a little guilty)
We were talking and he asked about
you... I think he could tell
something was wrong. He wanted to
hear how you were doing... I didn’t
know what to say.
WALT
How about “fine”?
SKYLER
I’m sorry. I didn’t think you’d be
so upset about it. What did he say
to you?

Oh, please.

Silence for a beat.

Skyler absorbs this.

WALT
That’s what you wanted, right?
SKYLER

him up to this.
WALT
Well, what did you think he was
gonna do? You tell the man I’m
dying -SKYLER
(erupting)
-- I did not tell him you are
dying! You are not -WALT
-- Whatever. Whatever, alright?!
He’s a multi-millionaire! What’s
he gonna say, “Sorry, too bad,
you’re on your own?”
SKYLER
So he wants to help -- why is that
a bad thing?
Walt, not completely sure why, struggles with this question,
trying to figure it out for himself. Skyler waits for an
answer, frustrated by his silence.
SKYLER
Walt, he wouldn’t offer you a job
if he didn’t think you were
qualified -WALT
-- Oh yes, he would. Because when
I turned down the job, he offered
to simply pay for the treatment.

ACT TWO
INT. WHITE HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MORNING
Walt, Skyler and WALTER, JR. are eating breakfast in tense
silence. Walt and Skyler, still upset from their fight,
aren’t even looking at each other.
The hostile energy is rubbing off on Walter, Jr. He’s a
teenager -- he’s already got enough pent-up anger. He gulps
down his orange juice and gets up to go.
Walt snaps out of his silence.

Clears his throat.

WALT
Need a ride?
WALTER, JR.
I’m taking the bus.
Walter, Jr. exits. He’s left most of his food untouched,
which does not go unnoticed by Skyler. She rises, grabs
Walter, Jr.’s plate, and stalks off to the kitchen.
Off Walt, alone at the table.

Martin (who we met in the Teaser) climbs out. Without his
dollar bill costume on, we can see his skinny frame. He
grabs a duffel bag from the backseat and heads for the RV.
INT. RV - MORNING
Jesse is setting up meth-cooking equipment on the counter.
Everything looks clean and organized. The door swings open
and Martin enters.
MARTIN
I’m here -- let’s fire it up!
(looking around)
Holy shit.
Wide-eyed, Martin drops his duffel bag and sidles up to the
counter, ogling Jesse’s setup.

CONTINUED:
MARTIN
Niiice. Look at this beaker...
it’s gynormous!
Martin picks up a ROUND BOTTOM BOILING FLASK, tossing it up
and down to gauge its weight. Jesse snatches it from him.
JESSE
Careful -- it’s fragile. And it’s
a boiling flask, not a beaker.
MARTIN
(rolling his eyes)
Sorry, dude.
Jesse gently puts the boiling flask in its proper place.
Points out the other equipment.
JESSE
This is a beaker. A Griffin
beaker, to be exact. This is a
volumetric beaker. Erlenmeyer
flask, Kjeldahl-style recovery
flask...
Martin is clearly surprised by Jesse’s expertise. Jesse is
starting to enjoy his role as meth-cooking guru. He points
to a jar of red phosphorus.
JESSE
This is the key. We combine this
with hydriodic acid and your
pseudo, cook it, and -- voila -freebase meth oil.
MARTIN
(impressed)
You really know your shit.
JESSE
It’s just basic chemistry, yo.
you got something for me?
Oh, yeah.

So

Martin picks up his duffel bag, unzips it and pulls out
several cases of SINUS TABLETS. He tosses them to Jesse,
who inspects them approvingly.
Okay.

JESSE
Now we’re in business.

Martin continues to unpack items from his duffel: a six-pack
of Pabst Blue Ribbon, a bag of Cheetos, several cans of
Spam, a stack of Maxim magazines...
JESSE
Jesus, Martin. We’re only gonna be
out there a couple days -MARTIN
Check it out.
Martin pulls out a WOODEN CROSSBOW and a bunch of CHROMETIPPED ARROWS.
MARTIN
Desert Fox Longbow. And these
babies have chrome tips with blood
gutters.
JESSE
What’re you bringing that for?
Hunting.

MARTIN
We might see javelinas.

Martin cracks open a beer. It’s nine o’clock in the
morning, by the way. Jesse eyes his new partner warily.
What’s he gotten himself into?
EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT
Walter, Jr. and two nerdy buddies, LOUIS (17) and SOREN

points to a baby-faced guy in a hooded sweatshirt, walking
toward the entrance.
WALTER, JR.

He looks younger than us. He’s
probably going in there to get a

A Ford pick-up truck pulls into the lot. A friendly-looking
man in a flannel shirt gets out and heads for the store.
LOUIS
This is our chance.
(nudges Walter, Jr.)
You’re up.
WALTER, JR.
Why do I always have to do it?
LOUIS
Gimme the crutches and I’ll do it.
Walter, Jr. rolls his eyes, but acquiesces and starts off
toward Flannel Shirt. Louis and Soren hang back, trying to
appear casual.
‘Scuse me?

WALTER, JR.

Walter, Jr. catches up to the guy, making a big show of his
forearm crutches. He pulls a twenty out of his pocket.
WALTER, JR.
We were wondering if you could do
us a favor and buy us a six of Bud
Light. We forgot our ID’s.
Flannel Shirt sizes up Walter, Jr. and his friends.
FLANNEL SHIRT
You know, a minor could go to jail
for asking a cop to buy alcohol.
WALTER, JR.
(taken aback)
A cop?
Flannel Shirt produces his wallet and flips it open to his
POLICE BADGE. He’s an OFF-DUTY COP.
Upon hearing this, Louis and Soren haul ass. They disappear
around the corner, leaving Walter, Jr. in the lurch,
standing there with the twenty dangling from his hand.
OFF-DUTY COP
Guess this is your lucky night.

26.

INT. CAR - NIGHT
Walter, Jr. is in the passenger seat, sullenly watching the
off-duty cop talk to someone in the parking lot (this is
shot in such a way that we can’t tell who it is). They’re
wrapping up their conversation.
The cop comes over and leans in Walter, Jr.’s window.
OFF-DUTY COP
This is not how I wanted to spend
my night off. Consider this your
first and last warning.
Yes, sir.

WALTER, JR.

OFF-DUTY COP
You’re lucky you got a good dad
here.
The cop gives Walter, Jr.’s “dad” a salute, then heads off.
The driver’s side door opens... and Walter, Jr.’s uncle HANK
slides in. This is his black Jeep.
Hank lets out a disapproving sigh.
WALTER, JR.
I only got nabbed ‘cause the other
guys ran.
Hank reaches over and pops him on the back of the head.
HANK
Not cool, man. Not cool.
WALTER, JR.
Sorry, Uncle Hank. I won’t try to
buy beer again, okay?
HANK
No, not that. Why you calling me
and not your dad?
Walter, Jr. doesn’t answer.

Just stares out the window.

That’s what Skyler told me.

I mean, you might as well have.
SKYLER

Hank and Marie are both stunned. And Hank is a little
impressed. He can’t help but smirk.

Marie punches Hank’s arm.

He rubs it, annoyed.

SKYLER
I could hardly believe it either.
But he admitted it to me pointblank. He was buying pot from a
former student of his... this
skeevy little shit.
HANK
Jesus. You sure the cancer hasn’t
metamorphosized to Walt’s brain?
Marie punches his arm again.

Hank glares at her.

SKYLER
I don’t know what to do. I can’t
believe he could be so stubborn -and stupid. Why would anyone in
their right mind choose not to get
treatment when it’s completely paid

MARIE
I’m sure he has his reasons.
SKYLER
What legitimate reasons could there
possibly be?
MARIE
Have you asked him?
SKYLER
Of course! But you know Walt -he’s like a brick wall. He doesn’t
talk about his feelings. Right now
we’re barely on speaking terms.

What we need to do is sit him down

Once again, Marie glares at him. Hank gives her a warning

Hank and Marie aren’t thrilled by the idea, but are trying
to be supportive. Off Skyler, her gears turning...
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
The RV is parked in a clearing, surrounded by trees.
CRICKETS are chirping. The RV’s curtains are drawn and it’s
lit up inside. A cozy picture -- could be a family on a
camping trip.

MARTIN outside the RV, sipping a Rock Star energy drink as
he takes a leak. He zips up and heads into:

HIP, INTENSE MUSIC comes up as we see a high-energy METHCOOKING sequence like the one in the Pilot. But this time,
Jesse is in the Walt role, commanding the operation.
Martin, clearly less capable, assists him.
Interspersed with shots of chemicals and procedures, we see
Martin taking frequent breaks -- napping, snacking, goofing
off. But Jesse is working the whole time. He’s focused, in
the zone.

The cook is done. The RV is considerably less tidy than it
was when they started. It’s beginning to resemble a frat
house after a keg party. Amidst the detritus we find...
... a GLASS TRAY filled with BIG, WHITE CRYSTALS. At first
glance, it looks just like the batch that Walt and Jesse
cooked in the Pilot.
Gripping a pair of tweezers, Jesse picks up one of the
crystals and inspects it closely. Martin stares in awe at
the tray of meth, drooling like a kid in a candy store.
MARTIN
You are a genius, bro. This
cankinstien is unreal. When we get
back, I’m gonna burn that stupid
dollar bill suit -- ‘cause this is
gonna make us some mad dough!
Jesse, still eyeballing the crystal, shakes his head.
JESSE
It’s not right.
MARTIN
Whaddya mean, “it’s not right”?
JESSE
It’s cloudy. It’s not s’posed to

Then he picks up the whole tray and, pushing past Martin,
heads outside.

But Jesse is unfazed by his whining.

for discarded crystals, now earmarked for his own personal
use. Waste not, want not...

He’s halfway across

... Skyler, Walter, Jr., Hank and Marie sitting there,
waiting for him. Oddly formal. On the coffee table is an
untouched PARTY PLATTER of assorted fruit and cheese,
covered in Saran Wrap.
A beat as Walt takes in this tableau of serious faces...
then Skyler reaches over and ceremoniously pulls the Saran
Wrap off the party platter.
SKYLER
Sit down, Walt.
INT. RV - AFTERNOON
The second cook is done. The RV is even more of a mess now.
Jesse and Martin are both exhausted and on edge. They’re
hovering over a new tray of meth.
Tense silence as Jesse picks up a crystal with his tweezers.
While he inspects it, Martin stares at Jesse intensely,
practically eye-fucking him.
This showdown seems to last forever... until finally, Jesse
puts down the crystal and shakes his head.
JESSE
We can do better.
Jesse picks up the tray, getting ready to throw it out -but this time, Martin grabs the other end.
MARTIN
Don’t you dare!
Thus begins a tug-of-war that sends crystals flying
everywhere. The tray falls to the floor and SHATTERS.

CONTINUED:
Martin goes psycho -- he jumps on top of Jesse and tries to
punch him. Jesse struggles to push him off. Neither of
these skinny dudes is much of a fighter. They look like a
couple of kids tussling at recess.
They fall to the floor and wrestle awkwardly, rolling over
shards of broken glass.
JESSE
Get off me!
With much effort, Jesse manages to scramble to his feet. He
grabs the closest thing -- the ROUND BOTTOM BOILING FLASK -just as Martin gets up and lunges for him. Jesse whacks him
in the abdomen --- THUNK! The boiling flask slams Martin like a bowling
ball and falls to the floor -- CRASH! -- exploding into
little pieces. Martin is enraged.
MARTIN
That’s it -- you’re dead!
Now it’s no holds barred. The fight gets noisier and more
ridiculous as Jesse and Martin try to hurt each other with
various pieces of LAB EQUIPMENT. The RV is getting trashed.
Getting the upper hand, Jesse backs Martin up against the
door. He kicks it open and shoves Martin out. Chucks
Martin’s duffel bag out after him.
Jesse slams the door shut and locks it.
EXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON - CONTINUOUS
WIDE ON the RV as Martin pounds his fists on the door. The
engine ROARS to life, and the RV starts to peel out of the
clearing.
Fuming, Martin reaches into his bag and pulls out his BOW

BOING! An ARROW gets lodged in the SPARE TIRE mounted on
the back.
Martin pumps his fist.

We PULL BACK to see a miserable Walt, as he pops the cheese
into his mouth. The “intervention” has been going on for a
while, and everyone looks worse for wear. Marie is
skeptical, Hank uncomfortable, Walter, Jr. sullen.
Sitting in his favorite recliner, all Walt wants to do is
pick up the remote, turn on the tube, and watch a little
“Star Trek: Voyager.” But no, he listens dutifully as...
... Skyler holds court. She sits on the couch, clutching a
THROW PILLOW to her belly. The pillow is embroidered with
the adage, “Find Joy in the Little Things.”
SKYLER
The bottom line is that you’re
being selfish, Walt.
Skyler catches herself, then rephrases more carefully, in
“intervention speak.”
SKYLER
I mean -- I, personally, feel that
the decision you’re making is not
in the best interest of our family
unit. In my opinion.
WALT
I’m the one who’s sick -SKYLER
-- Uh-uh, it’s not your turn yet.
You agreed to listen to what
everyone had to say first.
Fine.

WALT

Walt leans back, annoyed.
SKYLER
Elliott offered to help because he
cares about you. I know you have
issues with accepting help from
others. But under the present
circumstances, don’t you think
those issues are basically just...

I mean, not valid?

Here’s how I see it. You’re
drowning in the ocean and someone
throws you a life preserver. It’s
a no-brainer. You grab that thing
and hold on ‘til you get to shore.
You don’t say, “No thanks, I’d
rather sink and get mauled by
sharks.”
Silence. We get the feeling Skyler’s been rolling out the
metaphors for hours.
SKYLER
Okay. I guess we can start going
around the circle. You’re all an
important part of this family, and
Walt should know how you feel.
Hank, let’s start with you.
Shit. Hank was just grabbing some grapes from the platter.
He reluctantly puts them back.
HANK
Uhh, okay -- well -Wait.

SKYLER
Take the Talking Pillow.

Skyler passes the embroidered pillow to Hank, who awkwardly
places it on his lap. He turns to Walt, struggling to think
of something meaningful to say.
HANK
Look, buddy. I know I don’t tell
you often enough, but... I care
about you... a helluva lot. And...
this whole cancer thing... let’s
face it, you got dealt a shit hand

Okay, Walt, look at it this way.
It’s the bottom of the ninth, bases
loaded. You’re up. But you got a

I’m pissed off at you. ‘Cause
you’re a coward. You get cancer,

every day ‘til I was able to walk?
Remember how hellacious that was?

Despite Walt’s stubbornness, this gets to him. It’s

Thanks a lot, Marie!

Nice ambush!

Hey -- I wasn’t planning on
agreeing with Walt. But after
hearing all of you talk about his
future like he doesn’t even have a
say in it -SKYLER
-- He’s not gonna have a future if
he doesn’t get the treatment!
MARIE
Easy for you to say -- you’re not
the one who has to do it. I’m a
medical professional -- I see
people in this situation all the
time. Some of them don’t want to
spend their last months dying
slowly in a hospital, picked over
by doctors -- unable to get out of
bed or go to the bathroom by
themselves. Is that really what
you want for Walt?
Swayed by this argument, Hank raises his hand.
HANK
Can I take back what I said before?
I agree with Marie. Walt wants to
die like a man!
Skyler panics, realizing this is all backfiring on her.
SKYLER
I don’t want him to die at all!
That’s the whole point of this!
That’s why I asked you here -MARIE

You think taking a handout from

I’ll never be able to pay him back.
And after I die, you’re gonna be
indebted to him forever. Do you
really want that hanging over you?
SKYLER
I don’t care about that, Walt.
WALT
Well, I do. And I would prefer to
die holding my head up high, rather
than eating shit.
SKYLER
Please stop talking about dying -WALT
-- Why? That’s what this is all
about, isn’t it? You’re trying to
delay the inevitable by putting me
through some experimental treatment
that may not even work. It doesn’t
come with a guarantee. I could go
through hell and still end up dead.
SKYLER
You’re not the only one this
affects, Walt. What about me and
Walter, Jr.? What about...
(touches her belly)
Don’t you want to see your daughter
grow up?
Skyler is choking up.

Walt is, too.

WALT
Of course I do. But you have to
accept the fact that... it’s not
gonna happen. You heard the
doctor. Best case scenario, even
with the treatment... it’d be a
miracle if I made it to her third
birthday.

twenty pills a day. And -- no
offense, Hank -- I don’t want to
lose my hair. And I don’t want to
feel like shit all the time.
SKYLER
I know you’re scared. But you’re
not alone. We are gonna be there
with you every step of the way.
WALT
I know that -- and that’s the worst
part. You and Walter, Jr. are
gonna be taking care of me when I
can’t function anymore. You’re
gonna be sticking me with IV’s and
emptying my bedpan and cleaning up
my puke. When I die, that is what
you’re gonna remember about me.
And I’m sorry, but I don’t wanna be
remembered that way.
(a beat, then)
I didn’t get a choice about getting
cancer. This is the only choice I
get to make.
For once, Skyler doesn’t know what to say. Walt has clearly
moved everyone with his argument. As they all sit quietly,
letting his words sink in...

ACT FOUR
INT. WHITE HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING
The sun’s just coming in through the curtains. Walt lies in
bed, awake. He hasn’t slept much. He rolls over and looks
at Skyler’s side of the bed -- empty. He can hear her
puttering around in the kitchen.
On her nightstand, he sees her reading glasses, her
moisturizer, a stack of books -- some about pregnancy, some
about cancer.
Walt gazes at his wife’s things, tenderness filling him.
INT. WHITE HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
Skyler, wearing her pajamas and a pair of rubber gloves,
stands at the sink, vigorously scrubbing last night’s

skillet when Walt enters.
He comes up behind her and gently touches her shoulder.
Okay.

Skyler turns around to look at him.
Okay what?

SKYLER

WALT
I’ll do the treatment.
A beat as this sinks in on Skyler... A mixture of relief
and elation washes over her. Not bothering to take off her

Walt tries to read a magazine, but is too distracted. He
makes eye contact with Walter, Jr. who, miraculously, smiles
at him. Touched, Walt smiles back.
A door opens and a MEDICAL TECHNICIAN in scrubs pokes her
head in, consulting a clipboard.
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN
Walter White?
Skyler squeezes Walt’s hand.

He gets up from his chair.

INT. RADIATION SUITE - DAY
Bright, harsh light. We’re looking down at Walt, naked from
the waist up, lying motionless on a radiation table. He’s
on his back with his arms raised over his head -- his whole
body embedded in a FOAM CRADLE.
For a few beats, nothing happens. It’s disturbingly quiet.
Walt grows more and more nervous...
Then we hear a SUCTION NOISE, like a very loud vacuum
cleaner -- and the foam cradle CONFORMS to the shape of
Walt’s body as if he were a doll being packaged.
Off Walt, now completely immobilized...
INT. WALT’S CAR - DRIVING - DAY
Days later. Walt is by himself, driving through town, his
destination unknown to us. His cell phone CHIRPS. He picks
it up, checks the caller ID.
Walt hesitates a moment while he composes his thoughts, then
answers the phone:
Hello?

WALT

Gretchen is on the other end of the line.

She’s sitting in

GRETCHEN
It’s Gretchen.

Hi. How are you?
But Gretchen doesn’t want to make small talk.

She’s clearly

GRETCHEN
Elliott told me everything. I’m so
sorry, Walt. God... I don’t know
what to say.
I’m okay.

WALT
Really.

GRETCHEN
You have to take this money. It’s
not charity, it’s not even a loan -we both know it’s rightfully yours.
Silence as Walt absorbs this.

Then:

GRETCHEN
(gently)
Is this about you and me?
Walt responds with a calm politeness that puts even more
distance between them.
WALT
Absolutely not. And I appreciate
the offer. But it turns out my
insurance came through after all.
The HMO is gonna cover a majority
of the treatment. Guess the
teachers union is good for
something, huh?
Though Gretchen suspects he’s lying, she decides to let it
go. She’s pained by the emotional chasm between them, but
doesn’t know how to bridge it.
Good.

GRETCHEN
That’s great news.

CONTINUED:
WALT
But thank you anyway. It was very
kind of you and Elliott.
GRETCHEN
Keep in touch, okay?
Sure.

WALT
And thanks for calling.

Walt hangs up, leaving Gretchen with this painfully formal
goodbye. Then he pulls up to his destination. Jiggling the
gear shift just so, he puts the car into park.
As he stares out the windshield, we REVEAL we’re at:

INT./EXT. JESSE’S HOUSE - FOYER - DAY
Jesse comes to the front door, peers through the peephole.
Surprised, he takes a beat to process what he sees... then
slowly opens the door to find Walt standing before him.
Jesse eyes Walt -- a little wary, but also curious. Walt
didn’t come prepared with a big Jerry Maguire-like speech.
Instead, he says, simply:
WALT
Wanna cook?
And without further explanation, Jesse opens the door wider
and lets Walt in. As the door closes on us...
CUT TO BLACK.
